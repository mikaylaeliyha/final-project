<form class="other">
  <input type="checkbox" name="click1" value="something">
  Meditation will make you more resilient to stress.
  <br><br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="click2" value="something">
  Sit up straight with both feet on the floor, close your eyes, focus your attention on reciting
    -- out loud or silently -- a positive mantra. You may say “I feel at peach”
    or “I love myself”. Then, place one hand on your belly to sync the mantra
    with your breaths, let any distracting thoughts float by like clouds.
  <br><br>
</form>

<h3>Breath Deeply</h3>

  <br><br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="click2" value="something">

  <br><br>
</form>

<h3>Be Present</h3>
<form class="other">
  <input type="checkbox" name="click1" value="something">
  Slow down. Take five minutes out of your day to focus on only one behaview with awareness. Notice how the air feels on your face when you're walking and how your feet feel when they hit the ground. Feel the texture and taste of food if you're eating, focusing on each of your senses. You should feel less tense after this.
  <br><br>
</form>

<h3>Reach Out</h3>
<form class="other">
  <input type="checkbox" name="click1" value="something">

  <br><br>
</form>

<h3>Tune In To Your Body</h3>
<form class="other">
  <input type="checkbox" name="click1" value="something">
  Mentally scan your body and see how stress affects it. Lie on your back, sitting with your feet on the floor. Start at your toes, working your way up and notice how you feel. For 1-2 minutes, imagine each deep breath flowing to that body part. Repeat as you focus on different parts of your body.
  <br><br>
</form>

<h3>Decompress</h3>
<form class="other">
  <input type="checkbox" name="click1" value="something">
  Place a warm heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes. Close your eyes and relax your body. After the 10 minutes are over, remove the wrap and use a tennis ball or roller to massage the tension.
  <br><br>
</form>

<h3>Laugh Out Loud</h3>
<form class="other">
  <input type="checkbox" name="click1" value="something">

<h3>Get Moving</h3>

  <br><br>

Gratitude journals cancel out negative thoughts and worries.
  <br><br>
</form>

<h3>Five Senses Method</h3>
<form class="other">
  <input type="checkbox" name="click1" value="something">
  Take time to look at 5 things around you. It could be a table or a chair or a leaf, but take time to really look at it. Then listen to 4 things you can hear. Then feel 3 things you can touch. Do this for all of your five senses or as many as you need to, until you feel calm and relaxed.
